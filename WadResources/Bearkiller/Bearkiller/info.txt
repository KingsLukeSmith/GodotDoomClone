Description: 
This is a double barrel shotgun called "Bearkiller" for its extreme power.Fires 2 bullets with a spread similiar to the super shotgun's one.Alt fire 
makes you go for 3 seconds in an iron sight mode.Whit the alt-fire you reload slower than the normal fire but the shot is more accurate,useful for 
shooting enemies at long range!
Note:If you want bullet casing you have to remove the "//" near the A_SpawnItemEx in the decorate
